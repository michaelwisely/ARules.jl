ARules.jl
=========

Julia package for Association Rule Learning algorithms.

## Current Supported Algorithms

### Apriori (with rule generation algorithm)

The Apriori implementation is based on the book *Introduction to Data Mining*, written by Pang-Ning Tan, et al. A F_{2-1} Ã— F{2-1} method was used on Frequent itemset candidates generation.

## Planned

* FP-growth
